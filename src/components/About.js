            <p>
                I'm a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science graduate from CIIT College of Arts and Technology, 
                with a strong foundation in back-end development. Proficient in C#, C++, Python, HTML5, and CSS, 
                I have experience in building web and software applications, such as MiNotes, a video summarization 
                tool using AI, and Hanafuda, a collectible card game. I am passionate in my work, in my problem-solving, 
                and in my ability to deliver efficient solutions to anything presented to me.
